Leaving most of the layout heavy lifting\n * to the browser. __note:__ The default styles use `height: 100%` which means your container must set an explicit\n * height (feel free to adjust the styles to suit your specific needs).\n *\n * Big Calendar is unopiniated about editing and moving events, prefering to let you implement it in a way that makes\n * the most sense to your app. It also tries not to be prescriptive about your event data structures, just tell it\n * how to find the start and end datetimes and you can pass it whatever you want.\n *\n * One thing to note is that, `react-big-calendar` treats event start/end dates as an _exclusive_ range.\n * which means that the event spans up to, but not including, the end date. In the case\n * of displaying events on whole days, end dates are rounded _up_ to the next day. So an\n * event ending on `Apr 8th 12:00:00 am` will not appear on the 8th, whereas one ending\n * on `Apr 8th 12:01:00 am` will. If you want _inclusive_ ranges consider providing a\n * function `endAccessor` that returns the end date + 1 day for those events that end at midnight.\n */\n\nvar Calendar = function (_React$Component) {\n  _inherits(Calendar, _React$Component);\n\n  function Calendar() {\n    var _temp, _this, _ret;\n\n    _classCallCheck(this, Calendar);\n\n    for (var _len = arguments.length, args = Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n      args[_key] = arguments[_key];\n    }\n\n    return _ret = (_temp = (_this = _possibleConstructorReturn(this, _React$Component.call.apply(_React$Component, [this].concat(args))), _this), _initialiseProps.call(_this), _temp), _possibleConstructorReturn(_this, _ret);\n  }\n\n  Calendar.prototype.render = function render() {\n    var _props = this.props,\n        view = _props.view,\n        toolbar = _props.toolbar,\n        events = _props.events,\n        culture = _props.culture,\n        _props$components = _props.components,\n        components = _props$components === undefined ? {} : _props$components,\n        _props$formats = _props.formats,\n        formats = _props$formats === undefined ? {} : _props$formats,\n        style = _props.style,\n        className = _props.className,\n        elementProps = _props.elementProps,\n        current = _props.date,\n        props = _objectWithoutProperties(_props, ['view', 'toolbar', 'events', 'culture', 'components', 'formats', 'style', 'className', 'elementProps', 'date']);\n\n    formats = (0, _formats2.default)(formats);\n\n    var View = this.getView();\n    var names = viewNames(this.props.views);\n\n    var viewComponents = (0, _defaults2.default)(components[view] || {}, (0, _omit2.default)(components, names), {\n      eventWrapper: _EventWrapper2.default,\n      dayWrapper: _BackgroundWrapper2.default,\n      dateCellWrapper: _BackgroundWrapper2.default\n    });\n\n    var ToolbarToRender = components.toolbar || _Toolbar2.default;\n\n    return _react2.default.createElement(\n      'div',\n      _extends({}, elementProps, {\n        className: (0, _classnames2.default)('rbc-calendar', className, {\n          'rbc-rtl': props.rtl\n        }),\n        style: style\n      }),\n      toolbar && _react2.default.createElement(ToolbarToRender, {\n        date: current,\n        view: view,\n        views: names,\n        label: (0, _viewLabel2.default)(current, view, formats, culture),\n        onViewChange: this.handleViewChange,\n        onNavigate: this.handleNavigate,\n        messages: this.props.messages\n      }),\n      _react2.default.createElement(View, _extends({\n        ref: 'view'\n      }, props, formats, {\n        culture: culture,\n        formats: undefined,\n        events: events,\n        date: current,\n        components: viewComponents,\n        getDrilldownView: this.getDrilldownView,\n        onNavigate: this.handleNavigate,\n        onDrillDown: this.handleDrillDown,\n        onSelectEvent: this.handleSelectEvent,\n        onSelectSlot: this.handleSelectSlot,\n        onShowMore: this._showMore\n      }))\n    );\n  };\n\n  return Calendar;\n}(_react2.default.Component);\n\nCalendar.propTypes = {\n\n  /**\n   * Props passed to main calendar `<div>`.\n   */\n  elementProps: _propTypes2.default.object,\n\n  /**\n   * The current date value of the calendar.

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.
